I embarked on a self-imposed task to enhance my skills in creating pop-up boxes using JavaScript and CSS. A key feature of this exercise was to dynamically load content from the backend into the pop-up. I gave it the class name 'amend-box' because I was practicing making the amend-tags pop up box for my 'Chitter' project.
